Copyright (C) 2018-2022 Hugues Nouvel
_CODE NAME_ _quake 4_ AOS4 "TAMPAX"

The goal of _dhewm 3_ is bring _DOOM 3_ with the help of SDL to all suitable
platforms.

Bugs present in the original _DOOM 3_ will be fixed (when identified) without
altering the original gameplay.

This project use engine of _dhewm3_ with additional code by glKarin for ANDROID

# RELEASES

## Quake4 V1.4.2 release Named TAMPAX AOS4(betatest) by HunoPPC (08.11.2022)

* First version for AmigaOS4

# GENERAL NOTES

## Game data and patching

This source release does not contain any game data, the game data is still
covered by the original EULA and must be obeyed as usual.

## Compiling

- AmigaOS 4.1 Machine PowerPC
- Warp3D NOVA from A-EON
- OpenglES2 from A-EON
- EGL_Wrap library from HunoPPC 
- zlib (static)
- libcurl (static)
- libjpeg8 (static)
- libogg (static)
- libvorbis (static)
- libvorbisfile (may be part of libvorbis) (static)

## Back End Rendering of Stencil Shadows

The Doom 3 GPL source code release does not include functionality enabling rendering
of stencil shadows via the "depth fail" method, a functionality commonly known as
"Carmack's Reverse".

***Note*** that this **does *not* change the visual appereance** of the game.
The shadows look the same, they're just created in a slightly different way.
In theory there might be a small performance impact, but on hardware less than
ten years old it shouldn't make a difference.

## MayaImport

The code for our Maya export plugin is included, if you are a Maya licensee
you can obtain the SDK from Autodesk.
